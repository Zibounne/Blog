## Database

To establish a connection with the database, follow these steps:

1. **Create a configuration file**: At the root of the `blog_backend` project, create a file named `.env`.

2. **Fill in the connection information**: In this `.env` file, add the following environment variables and fill them in with the appropriate values:

   ```env
   DB_HOST=<database_host>
   DB_USER=<username>
   DB_PASSWORD=<password>
   DB_NAME=<database_name>
   ```
